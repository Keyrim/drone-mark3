# Mark 3 software

This is a student project for the course "State Estimation and Control" at the University of Chat GPT :smile:

(Except I graduated in setember 2024 so not rly a student :cry:)

## Project goals

- Lean to code in C++.
- State estimation of the attitude and position of a drone using an extended Kalman filter (EKF).
- Attitute and position control of the drone using a PID controllers.

## Projet roadmap / timeline

- [x] [25/06/2025] Right click, new project!
- [ ] Setup base project structure with CMake and C++. Devcontainer setup for perfect development experience :smile:
- [ ] Implement gyro driver
- [ ] Implement simple attitude estimator using quaternions representation (integrate Eigen library).
- [ ] Implement EKF for attitude estimation with gyroscope and accelerometer.
- [ ] TBD

## What I learned

- Comming soon!
